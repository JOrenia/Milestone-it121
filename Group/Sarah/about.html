            <h1>All About Me</h1>

            <p>Hi there! I'm Sarah Mohamed, and I'm on a journey to explore various aspects of life and express my
                creativity in different forms.</p>

            <p>On the weekends, you'll often find me in the kitchen, experimenting with new recipes and creating dishes.
                Cooking has become more than just a hobby; it's a way for me to express my creativity and share joy with
                friends and family. I use to hate it because I had to cook for my large family. Eventually I turned it into a fun task and now enjoy it.</p>

            <p>Family is at the core of my values. Spending quality time with loved ones is something I cherish the
                most.
                Whether it's a cozy evening at home, celebrating special occasions, or embarking on exciting adventures
                together, the bond with my family is irreplaceable.</p>

                <p>Traveling is a huge love of mine, I have been to many countries and a lot of states. My favorite countries visited are London, Turkey, Kenya and Dubai. I love these places becaus the food is so much better and the lifestyle is a lot more relaxed. I love Turkey because of the hospitality and the people are very friendly and kind. Another great place was London, i love the train and bus culture. If you want to get anywhere you just hop on the train and its so cheap! The food is amazing and so is the shopping malls. I love going to new countries or places and seeing how it is like to live in a different country and enviroment. Its very humbling and such a great experience. My next targets on my bucket list are Japan and Thailand! </p>

            <p>Good times are best enjoyed with friends, and I'm fortunate to have a wonderful circle of friends who
                share
                my passions. We love exploring new cafes, experimenting with art, and having deep conversations about
                life
                and the future. We also love movie nights and playing board games and sitting in a circle and laughing at the past. Having close friends who you consider family is truly a blessing.</p>

            <p>I also have a profound love for flowers; they make me happy and are aesthetically pleasing. Some might think they are a waste of money but i need a fresh bouquet every week or two. Their beauty
                adds
                a spark in my day. My mood is always better and happy, and I often find inspiration in their colors and shapes.</p>

            <p>If you're curious about my journey in the world of software development, art, cooking, or travel, feel
                free
                to connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahmohamed100"
                    target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.
                I'm excited to share my experiences and connect with like-minded individuals. I've been actively working
                on
                various projects that showcase my skills and interests. You can check out some of my projects on GitHub:
